what is left to do:

change name in the TAB. (React App -> Maestro+)

Theory or Features: (Features with slides would be better, IMO)

Jeremy: Maybe you can add an example of warning raised and example of type of analyis for attacker profile
Lea: vertex information what are the different fields ? what do they represent ? 
     Maybe a text section to explain warnings and attacker profiles

Objective : 

Lea: You speak about Maestro here without introducing the software/project, what is an account manager ?

Maestro:

Lea: For each picture which represents a feature, i would add some details, description bellow the title.
I would also reduce the speed of picture stream

INSA Rennes:

what was last year work, what are the project phases, what we focussed on this year, who are our supervisors etc

Style:

Augustin: draggable background??
